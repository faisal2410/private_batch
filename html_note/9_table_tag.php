// The HTML table tag is used to create tables on web pages. Tables are useful for displaying data in an organized and easy-to-read format. Here's an example of a basic HTML table:


// <table>
//   <tr>
//     <th>Header 1</th>
//     <th>Header 2</th>
//     <th>Header 3</th>
//   </tr>
//   <tr>
//     <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
//     <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
//     <td>Row 1, Column 3</td>
//   </tr>
//   <tr>
//     <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
//     <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
//     <td>Row 2, Column 3</td>
//   </tr>
// </table>

// Let's break this code down and look at each part of it.

// <table>: This is the opening tag for the table. It is used to indicate the start of a table.

// <tr>: This stands for table row, and is used to indicate the start of a new row in the table.

// <th>: This stands for table header, and is used to indicate a header cell in the table. Header cells are typically used for the first row in the table, to indicate what each column represents.

// <td>: This stands for table data, and is used to indicate a regular cell in the table. Regular cells are used for all rows other than the first row.

// </tr>: This is the closing tag for a row.

// </table>: This is the closing tag for the entire table.

// In addition to these basic tags, there are several attributes that can be used to modify the behavior and appearance of the table.

// border: This attribute specifies the width of the border around the table. For example, <table border="1"> would create a table with a border width of 1 pixel.

// cellspacing: This attribute specifies the amount of space between cells in the table. For example, <table cellspacing="10"> would create a table with 10 pixels of space between each cell.

// cellpadding: This attribute specifies the amount of space between the content of a cell and the cell border. For example, <table cellpadding="5"> would create a table with 5 pixels of space between the content and the border of each cell.

// width: This attribute specifies the width of the table. For example, `<The HTML table tag is used to create tables on web pages. Tables are useful for displaying data in an organized and easy-to-read format. Here's an example of a basic HTML table:

// The HTML table tag is used to create a table on a web page. It consists of several elements, including the table itself, rows (tr), and cells (td). Here are some examples of the most commonly used attributes associated with the table tag:

// border: This attribute specifies the width of the border around the table. It is usually set to "1" to create a thin border around the table. Example:

// <table border="1">

// cellpadding: This attribute specifies the amount of space between the cell content and the cell border. Example:

// <table cellpadding="5">

// cellspacing: This attribute specifies the amount of space between the cells in a table. Example:
// lua


// <table cellspacing="10">

// width: This attribute specifies the width of the table. It can be set in pixels or as a percentage of the available space. Example:

// <table width="50%">

// align: This attribute specifies the horizontal alignment of the table within its container. It can be set to "left", "center", or "right". Example:

// <table align="center">

// bgcolor: This attribute sets the background color of the table. Example:

// <table bgcolor="#f2f2f2">

// colspan: This attribute specifies how many columns a cell should span. Example:

// <td colspan="2">This cell spans two columns</td>

// rowspan: This attribute specifies how many rows a cell should span. Example:

// <td rowspan="2">This cell spans two rows</td>
