// CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a language used for styling and formatting web pages. It works in conjunction with HTML to create visually appealing and functional websites.

// CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles to them. Here is an example of a basic CSS rule:


// p {
//   color: red;
//   font-size: 16px;
// }


// In this example, the selector p targets all <p> tags in the HTML document. The properties color and font-size are then applied to the selected elements.

// Here are some common CSS properties that you can use to style your website:

// color: sets the text color of an element
// background-color: sets the background color of an element
// font-size: sets the size of the font
// font-family: sets the font typeface
// text-align: sets the horizontal alignment of text within an element
// padding: sets the amount of space between the content and the element's border
// margin: sets the amount of space between the element and other elements
// You can apply CSS styles to HTML elements in several ways, such as using an external style sheet, embedding the styles in the <head> section of the HTML document, or using inline styles.
