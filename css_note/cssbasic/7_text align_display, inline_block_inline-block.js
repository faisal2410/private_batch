// text - align: This property is used to horizontally align text within a block element.You can set it to left, right, center, or justify, depending on the desired alignment.
// Example usage:


// div {
//     text - align: center;
// }

// display: This property controls how an element is displayed on a webpage.The most common values are block, inline, and inline - block.
//     block: This value makes an element a block - level element, which takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.

//         inline: This value makes an element an inline - level element, which flows with the text and doesn't start on a new line.

// inline - block: This value is a mix of block and inline.It allows an element to be treated as a block - level element while also flowing with the text.

// Example usage:


// div {
//     display: inline - block;
// }


// Note: display can also be used to hide an element by setting it to none.
