// Style tag: The style tag is a HTML tag that is used to define style rules for HTML documents.It is typically placed in the head section of an HTML document and contains CSS code that defines the appearance and layout of elements on the page.

// Embedded style: Embedded styles are CSS styles that are included directly in an HTML document using the style tag.They are written as a set of rules within the opening and closing style tags, and apply to all elements within the HTML document that match the specified selectors.

// Named color: Named colors are predefined color values in CSS that can be used to specify the color of an element.Some common named colors include "red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple", "white", and "black".

//     Hexcode: A hexcode is a six - digit code used in CSS to specify a color using the RGB color model.It consists of a hash symbol(#) followed by six digits representing the intensity of the red, green, and blue color channels.For example, the hexcode for pure red is #FF0000.

//         RGB: RGB is a color model used in CSS to represent colors using a combination of red, green, and blue values.It is represented as an RGB value consisting of three numbers between 0 and 255, separated by commas, enclosed in parentheses.For example, the RGB value for pure red is(255, 0, 0).

// To use these concepts in CSS, you can define styles using the style tag, with selectors that target specific HTML elements.You can then use named colors, hexcodes, or RGB values to specify the color of an element.
