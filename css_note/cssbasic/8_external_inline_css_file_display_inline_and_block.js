// External CSS: This is a separate file that contains CSS code and is linked to an HTML document using the < link > element.This is useful when you want to apply the same styles to multiple pages, as you only need to update the external CSS file to make changes across all pages.
// Example usage:

// In your HTML document, add the following within the < head > section:


//     < link rel = "stylesheet" href = "styles.css" >

//         Then, create a new file called styles.css and add your CSS code.

// Inline CSS: This is CSS code that is applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute.This is useful when you want to apply styles to a specific element that differ from the styles applied to other elements on the page.
// Example usage:


//     < p style = "color: red;" > This text will be red.</ >

//         display: This property is used to control the layout behavior of an element.The two most common values are inline and block.

//             inline: This value allows elements to flow inline with other elements, as if they were part of the same line of text.
// Example usage:


//     < span style = "display: inline;" > This is an inline element</ >

//         block: This value makes an element take up the full width of the parent container and start on a new line.
// Example usage:


//     < div style = "display: block;" > This is a block element</ >
