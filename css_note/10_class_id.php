// In CSS, classes and IDs are used to select and style specific HTML elements on a web page.

// Classes are used to group together multiple HTML elements and apply the same style to all of them. To create a class in CSS, you use a period (.) followed by the name of the class. Here's an example:


// .my-class {
//   font-size: 16px;
//   color: blue;
// }
// In this example, we have created a class called "my-class" and set the font size to 16 pixels and the color to blue. To apply this class to an HTML element, you add the "class" attribute to the element's opening tag and set its value to the name of the class:


// <p class="my-class">
// This paragraph will have a blue font color and a font size of 16 pixels.</p>


// IDs, on the other hand, are used to select and style a single HTML element on a web page. To create an ID in CSS, you use a pound sign (#) followed by the name of the ID. Here's an example:


// #my-id {
//   font-size: 20px;
//   color: red;
// }

// In this example, we have created an ID called "my-id" and set the font size to 20 pixels and the color to red. To apply this ID to an HTML element, you add the "id" attribute to the element's opening tag and set its value to the name of the ID:


// <h1 id="my-id">This heading will have a red font color and a font size of 20 pixels.</h1>

// It's important to note that you should only use IDs for unique elements on a page, as each ID should only appear once. Classes can be used for multiple elements on a page. By using classes and IDs in CSS, you can apply specific styles to individual elements or groups of elements to create a customized and visually appealing web page.
