// Selectors in CSS are used to target specific HTML elements on a web page and apply styles to them. Here are some examples of selectors and how they are used:

// Element selector: This targets all instances of a particular HTML element on a web page. For example, the following code would target all p elements on a page and set their font size to 16 pixels:

// p {
//   font-size: 16px;
// }


// ID selector: This targets a specific HTML element with a unique id attribute. For example, the following code would target an element with the id of header and set its background color to blue:

// #header {
//   background-color: blue;
// }

// Class selector: This targets all instances of an HTML element with a particular class attribute. For example, the following code would target all elements with the class of highlight and set their font weight to bold:

// .highlight {
//   font-weight: bold;
// }

// Attribute selector: This targets HTML elements based on the value of their attributes. For example, the following code would target all a elements with an href attribute that contains the word "example" and set their font color to red:

// a[href*="example"] {
//   color: red;
// }

// Descendant selector: This targets elements that are descendants of other elements. For example, the following code would target all span elements that are descendants of div elements and set their font size to 14 pixels:

// div span {
//   font-size: 14px;
// }

// Child selector: This targets elements that are direct children of other elements. For example, the following code would target all p elements that are direct children of div elements and set their font color to blue:

// div > p {
//   color: blue;
// }

// Adjacent sibling selector: This targets elements that come immediately after other elements. For example, the following code would target all p elements that come immediately after h2 elements and set their font color to green:

// h2 + p {
//   color: green;
// }

// General sibling selector: This targets elements that come after other elements. For example, the following code would target all p elements that come after h2 elements and set their font color to gray:

// h2 ~ p {
//   color: gray;
// }


// Universal selector: This targets all elements on a web page. For example, the following code would set the margin and padding of all elements to 0:

// * {
//   margin: 0;
//   padding: 0;
// }
